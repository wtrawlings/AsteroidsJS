If you are doing a tutorial, always remember to add the source!

Some problems:
1. the ship does not go visibility = false. I think another loop is just drawing it still during it's update.
2. the "fly off the side of the screen" problem was solved. Error corrected.
3. May need to lower the speed of asteroids in the main object.
4. come up with a way to do an arrow head instead of a triangle so you can see the nose.
5. bullets may need FASTER speed.
6. we need a game pause and a death animation. Suggestion using 10 bullets flying in different directions when the collision happens.


I will come back to this issue with a different tutorial. There are several other asteroids game tutorials on youtube. Thanks again to Derek Banas for working on this tutorial.
