If you are doing a tutorial, always remember to add the source!

Some problems:
1. The ship visible problem was still not fixed. The game just keeps on playing.
2. the "fly off the side of the screen" problem was solved. Error corrected.
3. May need to lower the speed of asteroids in the main object or change the level 1 speed to low and the level 2 and 3 speed up.
4. come up with a way to do an arrow head instead of a triangle so you can see the nose.
5. bullets may need FASTER speed. (DONE from 5 up to 7 speed)
6. we need a game pause and a death animation. Suggestion using 10 bullets flying in different directions when the collision happens.
7. when the game starts we need a blink in animation so you are temporarily not vulnerable right after you are respawned at the center of the screen.


I will come back to this issue with a different tutorial. There are several other asteroids game tutorials on youtube. Thanks again to Derek Banas for working on this tutorial.

Asteroids was originally made in 1979.
